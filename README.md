# PETV83L-V.vineel-reddy---Brute-force-attack-simulator-with-detection
In this project, I built a simple web-based simulation of a brute force attack to demonstrate how attackers try to guess passwords by attempting many combinations. The goal was not just to simulate the attack, but also to show how we can detect and prevent such behavior using basic techniques.
